        <p class="project description">
            With the environment changing I wanted to show people what kind of impact we can have. I demonstrated this with the use of an augmented reality game for Android.</p>

        <h1 id="concept">It all starts with a concept</h1>
        <p> Before doing anything big I wanted to know what other people would think about my idea. I tested it with a simple powerpoint presentation. However I still wanted to give the user some form of influence. 
            This showed the positives and negatives of the way I presented my initial concept. It was not interpreted as I intended. Work had to be done.

        <p> I wanted to flesh out the concept a bit more by giving some idea of characters and evniroment. Now I would know what it would look like.

            <h1 id="AR">Augmented reality test</h1>
            <p>I wasn't really sure how I would do augmented reality. I had some understanding of the unity engine and wanted to expand my knowledge as well. Luckily Vuforia had an implimentation to use an image database for image tracking in a Unity build. 
                I had tot try this. So from there came the first test.</p>

            <p>The assets for the game also needed to developed for a greater sense of realism. Not only still assets, but animations.</p>

            <p>After further iterations the augmented reality game prototype was developed and people gained a understanding of what they were doing. Different people gave it a try and different reactions arose. 
                In the end I will probably iterate on this solution to create an even better one. </p>
